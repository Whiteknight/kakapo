Kakapo release 2

Changes:

Adds this release document (VERSION.txt), and the readme file (README.txt).

Status:

Kakapo is still in development - call it 'alpha'. Most of the advanced functions are effectively 
cripped by segfaults. Hopefully, Parrot 2.1 will address this.
 
At this point, the kakapo_base library, which consists mostly of PMC extensions, is usable. The
tests in t/bootstrap pass ('make test-bootstrap'). 

Note that the bootstrap tests are not exhaustive - they are intended to demonstrate that pieces work
well enough to build larger pieces. Eventually, Kakapo's own UnitTest system will provide thorough
testing.

Currently, Kakapo augments these PMC types with extra methods:

  - Exception (note: TT#1446)
  - Float
  - Hash
  - ResizablePMCArray
  - ResizableStringArray
  - String
  - Sub
  - Undef

In addition, the base library includes:

  - Global.nqp - provides use, export commands
  - Opcode.nqp - provides 'clean' names for pir opcodes
  - Parrot.nqp - Provides some miscellaneous Parrot helper code.
  - Pir.nqp - Routines to manipulate PIR, particularly to dynamically generate subs/methods.
