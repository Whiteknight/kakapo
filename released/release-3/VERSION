# Kakapo release-3 #


## Changes ##

Removed Configure.pl, Makefile, and associated stuff, plus the 'plumage/' directory. Replaced with setup.nqp, 
generating the ports/plumage info via distutils.pir.

Improved Exceptions, created Exception::Wrapper class with automatic type-number assignment.


## Status ##

Kakapo is still in development. At this point, it's "late alpha." The core functions in the base library are usable,
and the infrastructure changes have reduced the installation/deployment footprint.

 * * * * *

Currently, Kakapo augments these PMC types with extra methods:

  - Exception (note: TT#1446)
  - Float
  - Hash
  - ResizablePMCArray
  - ResizableStringArray
  - String
  - Sub
  - Undef

In addition, the base library includes:

  - Global.nqp - provides use, export commands
  - Opcode.nqp - provides 'clean' names for pir opcodes
  - Parrot.nqp - Provides some miscellaneous Parrot helper code.
  - Pir.nqp - Routines to manipulate PIR, particularly to dynamically generate subs/methods.
